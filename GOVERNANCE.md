# How oak-routing-ctrl is governed

Before this library reaches v1.0.0, its initial author may hold more votes on
its development directions (mostly due to limited resources vs management
overheads).

If you're interested in joining as co-contributor, please kindly open an Issue.
Any serious help is sincerely appreciated!

Once the library has reached v1.0.0 and the project has gathered at least 2
contributors, we will discuss how the future governance of the library should
be.
